  abstract = {Over the last decade, a globalization of the software industry took place, which facilitated the sharing and reuse of code across existing project boundaries. At the same time, such global reuse also introduces new challenges to the software engineering community, with not only components but also their problems and vulnerabilities being now shared. For example, vulnerabilities found in APIs no longer affect only individual projects but instead might spread across projects and even global software ecosystem borders. Tracing these vulnerabilities at a global scale becomes an inherently difficult task since many of the existing resources required for such analysis still rely on proprietary knowledge representation. In this research, we introduce an ontology-based knowledge modeling approach that can eliminate such information silos. More specifically, we focus on linking security knowledge with other software knowledge to improve traceability and trust in software products (APIs). Our approach takes advantage of the Semantic Web and its reasoning services, to trace and assess the impact of security vulnerabilities across project boundaries. We present a case study, to illustrate the applicability and flexibility of our ontological modeling approach by tracing vulnerabilities across project and resource boundaries.},

  abstract  = {Software applications integrate more and more open-source software (OSS) to benefit from code reuse. As a drawback, each vulnerability discovered in bundled OSS may potentially affect the application that includes it. Upon the disclosure of every new vulnerability, the application vendor has to assess whether such vulnerability is exploitable in the particular usage context of the applications, and needs to determine whether customers require an urgent patch containing a non-vulnerable version of the OSS. Unfortunately, current decision making relies mostly on natural-language vulnerability descriptions and expert knowledge, and is therefore difficult, time-consuming, and error-prone. This paper proposes a novel approach to support the impact assessment based on the analysis of code changes introduced by security fixes. We describe our approach using an illustrative example and perform a comparison with both proprietary and open-source state-of-the-art solutions. Finally we report on our experience with a sample application and two industrial development projects.},

These documented software weaknesses are “hiding in plain sight” and represent low hanging fruit for attackers. In this paper we present the Vulnerability Alert Service (VAS), a tool-based process to track known vulnerabilities in software systems throughout their life cycle. We studied its usefulness in the context of external software product quality monitoring provided by the Software Improvement Group, a software advisory company based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Besides empirically assessing the usefulness of the VAS, we have also leveraged it to gain insight and report on the prevalence of third-party components with known security vulnerabilities in proprietary applications.},

In addition, vulnerabilities may propagate to dependent packages, making them vulnerable too. This paper presents an empirical study of nearly 400 security reports over a 6-year period in the npm dependency network containing over 610k JavaScript packages. Taking into account the severity of vulnerabilities, we analyse how and when these vulnerabilities are discovered and fixed, and to which extent they affect other packages in the packaging ecosystem in presence of dependency constraints. We report our findings and provide guidelines for package maintainers and tool developers to improve the process of dealing with security issues.},
